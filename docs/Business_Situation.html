                    <img src="images/Project1_Loss_Insight.png" style="width: auto; height: auto;" alt="Main Image"/>   
                </section>
                <p>One of the most interesting insights from the analysis was the poor performance of the sub-category "Tables."
                     Overall, this category has shown a consistent decline year-over-year, 
                     culminating in a total loss of $8K in 2017 â€” almost 50% of its total losses of $18K over its lifetime.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    When break down the data by state, it became evident that most losses occurred in 2014,
                     with a significant decrease in following years. This could be explained by a high
                      initial investments or aggressive promotions during the launch phase.
                      However, a few states (Massachusetts, Florida,...), experienced significant losses in 2017, 
                       suggesting they may not be suitable markets to invest.
                    </br>
                    </br>

                    Interestingly, most of the states facing these challenges are located in the western U.S.
                     If the decision is made to continue operating in these markets,
                      it is crucial to identify the root causes of the losses.
                       This serves as a starting point for further investigation and potential strategic adjustments.

                <section>
                <div class="image-text-container">
                    <div class="text-box">

                </div> 
                <p>Some noteable highlights: We currently lack New and Promising Customers.
                    This gap could lead to operational challenges in the future.
                </p>
                <p>Our Potential Loyalist profit currently at $12K with 10,000 customers. This is acceptable, as this group consists of low spenders who shop frequently.
                    However, we should shift our focus to the At-Risk customers, who also number around 10,000 but generate significantly higher profits of $90K. These customers are high spenders but shop less frequently. To engage them, we should develop targeted marketing campaigns. Here are some ideas:
                    
                <br>
                <br><strong>1.Loyalty Programs</strong>: Offer points for every purchase that can be used to redeem for discount.
                <br><strong>2.Exclusive Offer</strong>: Personlized promotions for each Customer.
                <br>
                <br>Additionally, I have provided the Sales department with a customer segment list, 
                along with their most recent purchases, to help identify their interests.
